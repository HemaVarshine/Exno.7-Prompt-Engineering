1.Basic Prompt for Task Listing
```
Prompt:
"List 5 important tasks I need to complete today."
```
Expected Output:

2.Prompt for Task Prioritization
```
Prompt:
"List 5 tasks I need to complete today and rank them in order of priority."
```
Expected Output:

Finish assignment (High priority)
Check emails (Medium priority)
Call mom (Medium priority)
Clean room (Low priority)
Go for a walk (Low priority)

Observation:
Introduces urgency and structure through basic prioritization.

3.  Time-Sensitive Prompting
 ```
Prompt:
"I have 4 hours free today. Suggest a schedule to complete these tasks: cleaning, homework, gym, and grocery shopping."

"I have 6 hours available today. My tasks include: {Task List}. Create a prioritized and time-blocked schedule."
```

Use Case:
Daily planning with custom inputs—ideal for productivity apps, bots, or integrations.

Deliverables: Set of Prompts: From basic task lists to structured schedules Generated Task Plans: Sample outputs from different prompt types Prompt Templates: Customizable templates for regular use Insights: Observations on how prompt detail affects usefulness and output clarity Sample Comparison: Naive Prompt: "Give me a task list."

# Result: The Prompt is executed successfully
